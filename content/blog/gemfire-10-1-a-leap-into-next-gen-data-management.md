## Optimizing Persistent Data for Improved Return to Operations

In this latest release, the GemFire team has achieved remarkable milestones in performance, especially in optimizing persistent data. GemFire version 10.1 showcases significant enhancements through the increased parallelization of disk storage. By redefining the way GemFire manages data persistence on disk, we have enabled the scaling of IO operations to fully utilize the disk's capacity.

In our performance testing of persistence GemFire version 10.1, we've achieved throughput saturation of disk IO capacity!  With our testing infrastructure we were reaching around 4 GB/sec which is the limit of our controller. The recovery time ultimately depends on available disk throughput and capacity.

### Recovery Time Improvements (Version 9.15 vs 10.1):

* Recover Keys and Asynchronous Value Loading: From 83 minutes to 6.4 minutes
* Recover Keys Only: From 17 minutes to 1.1 minutes
* Recovery Time with a Single Index: From 32 minutes to 5 minutes
* Synchronous Value Recovery Time: From 55.8 minutes to 5.2 minutes

## Enhancing Connection Management for Large Deployments

Managing connections in large GemFire installations presents unique challenges. To improve ultra-low latency in connection management we've developed a solution that allows architects to manage connection pools on a per-server basis. Maintaining a per server connection pool eliminates the potential of connections drifting from a server, then moments later connections need to be reestablished.

To achieve this we did a comprehensive rewrite of the connection pool stack.  This led to a notable performance improvement, with up to a 2x increase in throughput.
Enhancing Internal Shutdown for Extreme-SLA Sensitive Applications
To enhance applications with stringent SLAs, we've refined the internal shutdown process a server goes through. This adjustment reduces the shutdown duration and enables clients to move to other servers in a swift and timely manner.  Contributing to a smoother rolling upgrade experience  and improved system performance during times of upgrades.

## Empowering Query Management

Introducing a new GemFire Query Manager, it is a sophisticated tool designed to empower system operators with deep insights into their running queries. This innovative tool is a game-changer in the realm of query management for GemFire, offering an array of powerful features. 
* **List Queries**: GemFire operators can effortlessly track and monitor active queries, gaining a comprehensive view of how applications and teams are using GemFire.. 
* **Describe Query**: Enables teams to dive deepering to what a query is doing providing detailed analytics and characteristics of each query, enabling a thorough understanding of their impact and behavior. 
 * **Cancel Query**: Allows operators to swiftly intervene and terminate queries that are impacting system performance. 

## Unlocking Deeper Insights into GemFire Operational Status

With GemFire being a high performance in memory database we seldom cared about answering “What is GemFire doing during startup” due to its quick starts.   However with data volumes approaching petabytes under management start up times can become long especially if the system wasn’t shutdown cleanly.   In order to increase transparency in the operational status of GemFire servers we have added several gfsh commands.. The Operational Insights feature, accessible through a dedicated gfsh command, provides users with detailed information about the operational state of their servers, covering Membership, Management, Region Recovery, and more.

## Optimizing Event Processing with Continuous Query Event Filtering

To address challenges during high-volume event processing, we introduce server-side event filtering. This feature allows Systems Designers to manage bulk operations effectively, enhancing system resilience and efficiency during critical operational periods.


By continually advancing and optimizing GemFire, we aim to provide our users with the most efficient, reliable, and high-performing system possible, suitable for a wide range of demanding applications. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to push the boundaries of GemFire technology.
