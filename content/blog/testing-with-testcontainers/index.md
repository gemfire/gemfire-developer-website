Until recently, the primary way to start GemFire during integration testing was using Spring Test for GemFire to bootstrap
a server application with Spring. With the recent release of GemFire Testcontainers 2.0.0, you can start a containerized
GemFire cluster and configure it via gfsh just like any other GemFire cluster.

## Benefits of Testcontainers

1. Because the GemFire cluster runs within Docker, you may be able to run your tests in parallel without running into port
conflicts, potentially saving you time and money.
2. You can configure your cluster using gfsh, giving you more flexibility to control your cluster.
3. The cluster stated with Testcontainers is essentially the same as any other clusterâ€“giving you more confidence that
your testing is representative of behavior in production.

## Getting started with Testcontainers

### Adding the dependency
The first step to using GemFire Testcontainers is to add it as a dependency to your project.
If you don't already have access to the GemFire commercial Maven repository, follow the steps on the [GemFire Developer Site](https://gemfire.dev/quickstart/java/).
Once you have access to the GemFire Maven repository, you can add a dependency on GemFire Testcontainers to your build.
Gradle: 
```kotlin
testImplementation("com.vmware.gemfire:testcontainers:2.0.0")

```
Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.vmware.gemfire</groupId>
  <artifactId>gemfire-testcontainers</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Getting the GemFire Image

Before you can start testing, you'll need to pick a container image for the version of GemFire you want to use. GemFire
images can be found on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gemfire/gemfire). Make sure to use the same version of GemFire that you built your application
with. If you plan to deploy code into your GemFire cluster, make sure to select an image with the same or higher JDK
version than the one used to compile the code to be deployed. For example, you may want `gemfire/gemfire:10.1-jdk17` if
your project uses JDK 17, which is required for Spring Framework 6 and later.

### Using Testcontainers in Your Test

Now that Testcontainers has been added as a dependency, and you have selected an appropriate GemFire image, you can
start writing or converting your test. First, make sure that you have Docker running in your environment.

The primary class you will use to set up and interact with your cluster is `GemFireCluster`. You create a `GemFireCluster`
by passing in the Docker image to use and the number of locators and servers to start. There are also several methods to
configure the cluster before it starts, such as `GemFireCluster.withGfsh()` and `GemFireCluster.withClasspath()`.
Then, you can accept the license and start the cluster.
Once started, you can access the locator ands server ports using `getLocatorPorts` and `getServerPorts`, which return a
`List` of `Integer`s. You'll probably want to set a property with the locator and/or server information, or introduce a
`ClientCacheConfigurer` bean to connect to the cluster. 

Here's an example of configuring and starting a GemFire cluster using Testcontainers:

```java
private static GemFireCluster gemFireCluster;

@BeforeClass
public static void startGemFireCluster() throws IOException {
  gemFireCluster = new GemFireCluster(System.getProperty("gemfire/gemfire:10.1-jdk17"), 1, 1)
      .withClasspath(GemFireCluster.SERVER_GLOB, "/path/to/some/jar")
      .withGfsh(false, "create region --name=Customers --type=PARTITION");

  gemFireCluster.acceptLicense().start();

  System.setProperty("spring.data.gemfire.pool.locators", String.format("localhost[%d]", gemFireCluster.getLocatorPort()));
}
```

The setup happens in a `@BeforeClass` method so GemFire will start before your test. After your test, you can shut down the cluster like this:

```java
@AfterClass
public static void stopGemFireCluster() {
  gemFireCluster.close();
}
```

After your cluster is running, you can interact with it using Gfsh commands via `GemFireCluster.gfsh()`. This is
different from `withGfsh` that we used earlier, because commands passed to `withGfsh` run when the cluster starts while
commands passed to `gfsh` run immediately. If you're deploying code using Gfsh's `deploy` command, you'll need to
make the jar file accessible to Docker by using `GemFireCluster.withPreStart` and copying the file to the container
before the cluster starts.

```java
gemfireCluster.withPreStart(GemFireCluster.ALL_GLOB, container -> 
  container.copyFileToContainer(MountableFile.forHostPath("/local/path/to/jar"), "/destination/path/in/container"))
```

Now you can invoke the `deploy` command like normal, using the path to the jar in the container.

If you want to see logs from your GemFire members, the best way to do that is to view them in Docker Desktop by clicking
on the relevant container.

That's essentially all that's required to use Testcontainers to test your Spring for GemFire apps.

There have been some changes with the 2.0 release, but there is still lots of valuable information in there.
