# **Trail Guide to GemFire OQL: Object Query Language**
## **Overview**

VMware GemFire supports a query language known as Object Query Language (OQL).
OQL was originally developed between 1993 and 2001 by the
[Object Data Management Group (ODMG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Data_Management_Group) for object databases. The most recent specification
for OQL (ODMG 3.0)was published by OMDG in book form[^1].
OQL was later used as the basis for the query language
used in the [Java Data Objects (JDO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Data_Objects) specification, known as JDOQL.

For more information about the particular dialect of OQL used in GemFire, please consult the
[Querying section of the GemFire Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire/10.0/gf/developing-querying_basics-chapter_overview.html).

## **Differences between SQL and OQL**
The basic advantages of OQL are given in the GemFire docs as:
  - You can query on any arbitrary object
  - You can navigate object collections
  - You can invoke methods and access the behavior of objects
  - Data mapping is supported
  - You are not required to declare types. Since you do not need type definitions, you can work across multiple languages
  - You are not constrained by a schema

This article will go a little deeper into the aspects of *composable expressions*
and method invocations.
### **Composable Expressions**
A basic difference between OQL and SQL is that OQL consists
entirely of *expressions*, including the
`SELECT` expression which is the core expression for querying.

Since `SELECT` is an expression and not a *statement*, it can be embedded
in more complex expressions *anywhere a collection value is needed*.
This makes the language very composable where expressions
can be nested within each other to the extent that the required (runtime)
types are in alignment.

As an example of the flexibility of this kind of composability, consider
a query that gets the number of people who have a spouse that is older
then themselves. Assuming a `person` region with person objects
that have a `spouseId` property, and considering that a select expression
can be used anywhere a collection is expected, you could write an OQL query like:

```sql
select count(*)
  from /person as p
  where p.spouse_id != 0
          and p.age <
            element(select s.age
                    from /person as s
                    where p.spouse_id = s.id
                            and p.age < s.age)
```
The `ELEMENT` function applies to a collection that is known to have exactly
one element and extracts the single element from it.
### **Method invocation on Objects**
The other main difference from SQL is that OQL allows methods and simple attributes to be evaluated on objects. In Java, a simple attribute using dot notation
like `myObject.x` gets translated to either a public field or a call to a
getter method such as `myObject.getX()`. Methods that take parameters can also
be invoked in OQL.

Care should be taken when working with methods implemented
in languages like Java where arbitrary methods (and even "getters") can cause
data mutation and other side effects. Since OQL is declarative, the
order of expression evaluation is not always predictable or prescribed,
it works best when the methods invoked in the query language are pure "read-only"
functions, returning values without causing side effects.

## **Evaluating queries in a REPL**

Let's look at some query expressions to demonstrate these points. A simple ["REPL" (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) tool is used here where a OQL expression is entered and the REPL tool will evaluate the expression and print the result. We'll show the prompt
for this tool as `oql> ` and the printed result immediately after on the
next line.

In GemFire, you can use the provide console tool called `gfsh` as a REPL, of sorts, for trying out queries. The syntax within `gfsh` is:
```
query --query=<Select_Expression>
```
However, when evaluating OQL expression in `gfsh`, you are currently limited to using only a SELECT Expression. This can be very useful for evaluating queries against a running GemFire cluster for experimental and debugging purposes. However, because of this limitation,
the queries shown in this article are run instead in a simple REPL tool running in a
GemFire server (peer member), so it doesn't have this limitation. The source
code for this tool is shown at the end of this article.

Note that this same limitation of using a `SELECT` expression only also applies when querying against partitioned regions, whereas more complex expressions can be used when querying replicated (or local) regions.

### **Set up REPL and example data**
If you would like to follow along with evaluating these example queries, here
are step-by-step instructions using `gfsh` to start a GemFire cluster and
populate some example data.

1. Start a locator
```shell
% gfsh -e "start locator --name=locator"
```
2. Start the Query REPL so it joins the cluster as a peer. \
(See Source Code for `QueryRepl.java` and notes at end of this article)
You should get a prompt at the command line:
```
oql>
```

3. Run the `query.gfsh` script \
This source for this script is also given at the end of this article.
This creates the `employees` region and populates it with sample data.

```shell
% gfsh run --file="query.gfsh"
```
You can test that the data is there with:
```shell
% gfsh -e "connect" -e "query --query='select * from /employees'"
```
You should see output showing a table with 14 rows of employee data, something
like:
```
firstName |  lastName  | emplNumber |            email             | salary | hoursPerWeek
--------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------
"Jamie"   | "Jive"     | 10005      | "Jamie.Jive@example.com"     | 60000  | 20
â€¦ etc
```

### **Evaluate example queries in the REPL**
The following are example queries that show some valid OQL queries:

```sql
oql> 'Hello World'
	Hello World

oql> 2 + 2
	4

oql> ELEMENT(SELECT * FROM /employees WHERE emplNumber=10006).hoursPerWeek >= 30
	true
```

## **Elements of a SELECT expression**

The SELECT expression has the form:

> `SELECT` *projectionList* `FROM` *fromClause* [`WHERE` *booleanExpression*]

> *projectionList* := (`*` |  *projection* {`,` *projection*}) \
> *projection* := *attribute* | *expr* | *aggregationExpr* \
> *aggregationExpr* := *aggOp*`(`*projection*`)` \
> *aggOp* := `MIN` | `MAX` | `SUM` | `AVG` | `COUNT`

> *fromClause* := *collectionExpr* {`,` *collectionExpr*}

By convention, this grammar definition includes these symbols:

```
:=  : a grammar production rule showing a breakdown of syntactical parts
{ } : zero or more repetitions
( ) : a group of elements
|   : alternatives.
```

A *collectionExpr* is any expression that evaluates to a value of type
collection, and a *booleanExpr* is any expression that evaluates to a value of type boolean.

A Select expression can also be followed by ORDER BY and/or GROUP BY clauses,
the details of which are not be covered in this article.

### **Subqueries**
A select expression itself evaluates to a value of type collection, so it
is possible to nest select expressions within select expressions, as long as types line up. Some examples:

-- TO DO: make these working queries in the REPL

```sql
-- select expression used in an IN operator, in a WHERE clause
SELECT firstName, lastName FROM /employees
  WHERE deptId IN (SELECT id FROM /departments
                   WHERE location.state = 'OR')

-- select expression used in a FROM clause
-- gets the average of the department average salaries
SELECT
    AVG(average_salary)
FROM
    (SELECT AVG(salary) average_salary
      FROM /employees
    GROUP BY department_id) department_salary

-- select expression used in a projection
SELECT
    employeeId,
    firstName,
    lastName,
    salary,
    -- calculate average salary
    (SELECT AVG(salary)
        FROM /employees) as average_salary,
    -- calculate the difference between salary and average salary
    salary - (SELECT AVG(salary)
        FROM /employees) difference
FROM
    /employees
```
### **Joins**
Queries that read from more than one region, or the same region more
than once (a *self-join*) can often be simplified and evaluated more
efficiently by using *joins* instead of subqueries. In OQL, a join
between regions is indicated by referencing more than one region
in the *FROM* clause.

### **Example Domain Class**
```java
package com.vmware.query.tool;

import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.StringJoiner;

public class Employee implements Serializable {
  public String firstName;
  public String lastName;
  public int emplNumber;
  public String email;
  public int salary;
  public int hoursPerWeek;

  public Employee() {}

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return new StringJoiner(", ", Employee.class.getSimpleName() + "[", "]")
        .add("firstName='" + firstName + "'")
        .add("lastName='" + lastName + "'")
        .add("emplNumber=" + emplNumber)
        .add("email='" + email + "'")
        .add("salary=" + salary)
        .add("hoursPerWeek=" + hoursPerWeek)
        .toString();
  }
}
```

### **Query REPL Tool**

Notes:
  - Make sure `gemfire-dependencies.jar` and the domain class are in the class path
  - use a `gemfire.properties` file to specify the locator so `gfsh` can find this server, e.g.:

#### **GemFire Properties file `gemfire.properties`**
```
  locators=localhost[10334]
```
#### **REPL tool `QueryRepl.java`**

```java
package com.vmware.query.tool;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

import org.apache.geode.cache.Cache;

          printResults(results);
        }
      } catch (final Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
      }
    }
  }

  private static String promptLine(final BufferedReader in) throws IOException {
    System.out.print("\nquery> ");
    return in.readLine();
  }

  private static void printResults(final Object results) {

      printSelectResults((SelectResults<?>) results);
    } else {
      System.out.printf("--> %s\n", results);
    }
  }

  private static void printSelectResults(final SelectResults<?> results) {
    System.out.println("Query returned " + results.size() + " results.");
    for (final Object obj : results.asList()) {
      System.out.printf("--> %s\n", obj);
