It is with great sadness that I write this foreword for the latest release of GemFire, version 10, which we have dedicated to the memory of our beloved team member, Gideon Low. Gideon was an exceptional engineer, with over 18 years of continuous service in a variety of roles. He was a gifted problem solver and an expert in his field. He leaves behind a legacy of successful engagements, having assisted in the architecture of some of the most complex and mission-critical systems in the world.

Beyond his technical skills, however, Gideon was an extraordinary human being. His upbeat attitude, never-ending enthusiasm, and generous spirit were an inspiration to all who knew him. He was a true leader, always willing to lend a helping hand, and he had a special talent for bringing out the best in people. His loss has been deeply felt by everyone at GemFire, and [we extend our deepest sympathies to his wife and child](https://www.gofundme.com/f/gideon-low), as well as to his friends and family.

Gideon’s passing has been a reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment. It has also reinforced our commitment to creating software that can make a difference in people’s lives. The Gideon release of GemFire is more than just a new version of our product; it is a tribute to the legacy of an exceptional human being who inspired us all to strive for excellence and to make the world a better place.

We hope that this release of GemFire will serve as a lasting testament to Gideon’s remarkable contributions to our team and to the broader technology community. We know that he would have been proud of the work we have done, and we will continue to honor his memory by pushing the boundaries of what is possible with in-memory data grids.

In closing, I would like to express my gratitude to Gideon for the impact he had on all of our lives. He will be deeply missed, but his legacy will live on through the many lives he touched and the countless achievements he helped make possible. Rest in peace, Gideon. 

You will never be forgotten.
