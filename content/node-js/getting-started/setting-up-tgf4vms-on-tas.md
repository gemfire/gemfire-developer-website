This guide walks you through creating a Tanzu GemFire service instance on the Tanzu Application Service.

## Option 1: Create the service instance using the cf CLI

Starting in a terminal

1. Run `cf login`, and create or target your organizationâ€™s space.

2. Run `cf marketplace -s p-cloudcache` to list your available VMware Tanzu GemFire plans. Take note of the `service plan` as this will be your `<PLAN-NAME>` in the following step. Note that Tanzu GemFire was previously called Pivotal Cloud Cache).

3. Create a Tanzu GemFire service instance within the space with the following command:
   
   `cf create-service p-cloudcache <PLAN-NAME> <SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME>`
   
   * Replace `<PLAN-NAME>` with one the plan names from step 2.
   * Replace `<SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME>` with your own custom name for your service instance.
    
    The `<SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME>` can include alpha-numeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. This is also the name you will use in your `manifest.yml` to bind your client application to the service instance.
   
4.  If successful you will see 
    
    **OK**
    
    `Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service <your-service-name>' to check operation status.`
   
5. Confirm the Tanzu GemFire service instance has been created by running  
   
   `$ cf services`
   
   This command outputs the current status of the service instance creation.  In the **last operation** column you will either see `create in progress` if it is still be created or `create succeeded` when it is ready to be used.
   
   **It can take several minutes for the service instance creation to complete.**
     
   
## Option 2: Create the service instance using Tanzu Application Service apps manager

&nbsp;

6.  Fill in the **Instance Name** with a custom name for your service instance. The service instance name can include alpha-numeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. This is the name you will use in your `manifest.yml`.  (Alternatively, if you have already pushed your application to your space can select it in the "Bind to App" dropdown - however we prefer to bind our applications through a `manifest.yml` file)
    
    Click **CREATE**

7.  After clicking create you will see Tanzu GemFire service instance provisioning begin and in the **Last Operation** column it will say `create in progress`.

**It can take several minutes for the service instance creation to complete.**

&nbsp;

8.  Once complete you will see `create succeeded` under the **Last Operation** column (you may need to refresh the page for the status to update).
