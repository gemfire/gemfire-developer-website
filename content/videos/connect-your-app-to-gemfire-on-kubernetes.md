description: In this video Laura Mar√≠n demonstrates how to connect a non-Kubernetes application to a VMware GemFire cluster running in Kubernetes.
---

This "off-platform" access is a new feature in version 2.2 and makes it easy to run separate Kubernetes clusters for data services and applications. You can also use this when the applications are hosted external to Kubernetes while still retaining GemFire's low latency data access.

Using this approach you gain the benefit of a managed data service with automated service creation and zero downtime upgrades but have the flexibility to run on-premise, in the cloud, or in a hybrid model as your needs dictate.
