The world of payments is changing rapidly. The FedNow service from the Federal Reserve Board will be here by July 2023, overhauling the current Federal automated clearinghouse (ACH) systems. Payments processed over the FedNow Service would settle between financial institutions in real time and end users would now have immediate access to money sent to them. Please join Nainesh Jhaveri from the VMware GemFire product team as he explains how you can leverage GemFire to securely write payments in two availability zones and speed up the downstream processing. This way you can be absolutely sure that the desired SLAs are always met as expected by the Real Time Payment systems.
