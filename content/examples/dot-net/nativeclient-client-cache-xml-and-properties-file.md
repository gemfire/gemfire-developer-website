description: This is VMware GemFire sample code that uses client.properties file along with client.xml file.
 
---

This is a sample that uses `client.properties` file along with `client.xml` file. This approach applies the client properties from a file instead of hard coding them into your code. It's a simple command line program that connects to a region using a cache factory object and does not involve any dependency on Java. Please refer to [the docs](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Native-Client-for-VMware-GemFire/10.4/NC-for-GF-v10.4/dotnet-geode-native-docs-dotnet-connection-pools-configuring-pools-attributes-example.html) for more details.  

This sample was created, built and tested with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.
